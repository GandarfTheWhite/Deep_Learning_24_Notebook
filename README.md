# Deep_Learning_24_Notebook
Jupyter notebook for Deep Learning Assessment at Bournemouth University, during semester one of 2024-2025 accademic year.

The task was to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a dataset of images of vehicles in 5 classes: Sedan, SUV, Hatchback, Pickup and Other, and make predictions on a test dataset.
Exploring various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures, implementing an appropriate one, and conducting the empirical evaluation for improving the performance of the selected architecture.
